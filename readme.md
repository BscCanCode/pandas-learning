# Pandas Learning Log

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of pandas, with the goal of building a **strong and correct data-handling foundation**, not a showcase of polished projects.

This is a **learning repository**, not a portfolio.

The files here represent small, focused experiments where I explored how pandas behaves in real situations — how DataFrames and Series work, how operations affect data state, and how common data problems are handled in practice.

I intentionally focused on understanding **why** things work instead of memorizing syntax.

## What this repository contains

- Reading and writing data in different formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Inspecting data structure and metadata (`head`, `tail`, `info`, `describe`, `shape`, `columns`)
- Understanding Series vs DataFrame behavior
- Column selection and boolean filtering
- Updating values safely using `loc`
- Sorting data by single and multiple columns
- Handling missing values using `dropna`, `fillna`, and interpolation
- Grouping and aggregation using `groupby`
- Combining datasets using `merge` (inner, left, right, outer joins)
- Combining datasets using `concat` (vertical and horizontal)

Some files are intentionally exploratory and mix operations. These are **learning sandboxes** created to observe how different functions affect the DataFrame, not examples of clean or final pipelines.

This repo exists to document learning honestly, including experimentation and intermediate understanding.


This repo is about **learning correctly**, not learning fast.
